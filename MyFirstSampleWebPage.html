    <h1>Hello</h1>
	<p>This is a simple web page using HTML5. Here is a sentence with 
		some <i>italic text</i> and <em>text with emphasis</em>.
		Here's another sentence with <strong>strong text</strong> and <b>bold text</b>.</p>

    	<p>The emphasis tag looks the same as the italic tag and the strong tag looks 
		looks the same as the bold tag when not using CSS to style the elements.
		There is a semantic purpose in HTML5 for using em or strong over i or b.
		One example would be the effect emphasis has on screen readers which will read
		the text louder than if it was just bold.
	
	<p>Italic is used for alternate text such as foreign or technical terms.
		Bold is used for stylistic offset such as for keywords or product names.
		Emphasis is used for words you would pronounce differently.
		Strong is used to represent importance. 
		
	<p><mark>This text is highlighted with the <em>mark</em> text element.</mark></p>
