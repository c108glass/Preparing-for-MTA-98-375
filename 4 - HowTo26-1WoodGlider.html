<h2>How to assemble the No. 26-1 Wood Glider</h2>
    <p>This is a step by step guide for assembling the No. 26-1 Balsa Wood Glider.</p>
    <p>You can find this 9" glider for about $2 here: <a href="http://www.guillow.com/BalsaToyAirplanes.aspx">Guillow.com - Balsa Toy Airplanes</a> 
        and here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guillow-26-Balsa-Glider-Guillows/dp/B000GKU2CU">Amazon.com - Guillow 26 Balsa Glider</a> </p>
    <p>The assembly is very easy and everything you need comes included in the kit. 
        Each step is listed below and includes a photo for reference as well as a complete video with flight test.</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>First remove the contents from the package and carefully pop out the pieces. 
        There should be a body, wings, stabalizer, rudder, and canopy.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Gently slide the wings into the gap in the middle of the body. Balsa wood is very fragile. It helps to push the wings 
        in just enough so that you can grab and pull from the other side
        while applying counter pressure to prevent the body and wings from breaking.
        Try to position the wings evenly so that they are about the same length on either side of the body.</p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Now, gently place the stabalizer in the rear slot of the body. Again, try to position it as evenly as possible.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Alright, it's starting to look like a glider! 
        Now gently place the rudder in the slot on top of the body, just above the stabalizer at the rear.</p>
